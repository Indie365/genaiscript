The image shows a screenshot of a GitHub pull request page. The pull request is titled "Update EDW998PCal.tla #1" and is from a branch named "lemmy-patch-1" into the "master" branch. A bot identified as "github-advanced-security" has flagged potential problems 25 minutes ago. Below, part of a file is shown with a diff view highlighting changes between two versions. Two lines have been altered, where an "ASSUME" statement's comment has been updated from "At least one node" to "Any number of nodes between zero and infinitely many." There's an alert from the TLA+ Linter indicating that the comment is consistent with the TLA+ declaration `N \in Nat \ {0}` which means N is a natural number excluding zero.

Below this, there is a dismissible alert box titled "Check notice" with a "Dismiss alert" button. At the bottom of the screenshot, there's a note that "Some checks were not successful," indicating 1 successful check and 1 failing check. The successful check is by "TLA-linter / TLA-linter (pull_request)" and the failing check is "Code scanning results / genaiscript." There's also a reference to a commit push action to the "master" branch from another branch and a prompt suggesting to add more commits by pushing to the "lemmy-patch-1" branch on "lemmy/Examples".
