This is another instance of using the LLM to produce translation of natural strings with an embedded DSL, similarly to the [Documentation Translation](./documentation-translations.mdx) guide.

[MakeCode](https://makecode.com) uses a [microformat](https://makecode.com/defining-blocks) to define the shape of coding blocks.
When translating the format strings, it is critical to converse the properties of the blocks, such as the number of arguments, their types, and the order of the arguments.

<Code code={stringsJson} wrap={true} lang="json" title="strings.json" />

The challenge with translation is that the localized string often contain escaped characters that break formats like JSON or YAML. Therefore, we use a custom simple `key=value` format
to encode the strings, to avoid encoding issues. We use the `defFileMerge` feature to convert the parse key-value file, and merge them with the existing translations.

The full script is show below.

<Code code={scriptSource} wrap={true} lang="js" title="loc-strings.genai.js" />
