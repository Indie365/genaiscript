This is another instance of using the LLM to produce translation of natural strings with an embedded DSL, similarly to the [Documentation Translation](./documentation-translations.mdx) guide.

[MakeCode](https://makecode.com) uses a [microformat](https://makecode.com/defining-blocks) to define the shape of coding blocks.
When translating the format strings, it is critical to converse the properties of the blocks, such as the number of arguments, 
their types, and the order of the arguments.

The [localization strings](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-jacdac/blob/45d3489c0b96ed0f74c9bbea53fb0714ae9f7fcc/buzzer/_locales/jacdac-buzzer-strings.json#L1) for the buzzer library are:

<Code title="jacdac-buzzer-strings.json" code={stringsJson} wrap={true} lang="json" />

For example, the string for the [Jacdac buzzer play tone block](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-jacdac/blob/45d3489c0b96ed0f74c9bbea53fb0714ae9f7fcc/buzzer/_locales/jacdac-buzzer-strings.json#L5-L6) 
contains reference to variables (`%music`) that should be maintained in the translated string.

```json
{
    ...
    "modules.BuzzerClient.playTone|block": 
        "play %music tone|at %note|for %duration",
    ...
}
```

and Bing Translate gives us the following translation

```txt title="Bing Translator"
%Musikton|bei %Note|für %Dauer abspielen
```

As one can see, bing translated the `%variable` name which will break the block definition.

The [GenAIScript translation](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-jacdac/blob/45d3489c0b96ed0f74c9bbea53fb0714ae9f7fcc/buzzer/_locales/de/jacdac-buzzer-strings.json#L5) is correct.

```txt title="GenAIScript"
spiele %music Ton|bei %note|für %duration
```
If you look closely in the script source, you will find guidance in the prompt to properly
handle the variables.

```js title="block-translator.genai.js"
$`...
- Every variable name is prefixed with a '%' or a '$', like %foo or $bar.
- Do NOT translate variable names.
...
`
```

## Script

The full script is show below.

Another challenge with translations is that the localized string often contain escaped characters that break formats like JSON or YAML. Therefore, we use a custom simple `key=value` format
to encode the strings, to avoid encoding issues. We use the `defFileMerge` feature to convert the parse key-value file, and merge them with the existing translations.
