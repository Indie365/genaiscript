Once you have a script that you are happy with, you can automate it using the [command line interface](/genaiscript/reference/cli).

## Running a script using the CLI

The basic usage of the CLI is to [run](/genaiscript/reference/cli/run/) a script with a tool name and a list of files.

```sh wrap
npx --yes genaiscript run <script> <...files>
```

The CLI will use the secrets in the `.env` file, populate `env.files` with `<...files>`, run the script
and emit the output to the standard output.

:::tip

[npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx) allows you to run a command 
from the [genaiscript npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/genaiscript) (either one installed locally, or fetched remotely). 
Add `--yes` flag skips the confirmation prompt.

:::

### Apply Edits

Add the `--apply-edits` flag to the CLI to automatically write the file edits.

```sh wrap "--apply-edits"
npx --yes genaiscript run <script> <...files> --apply-edits
```

:::caution

An LLM maybe generate arbitrary code that can be harmful to your system. 
We recommend that you review the modified code before executing it. This could be done through a separate
branch and a pull request.

Refer to [Security and Trust](/genaiscript/reference/security-and-trust) for more discussion.

## Batch run scripts

If you want to apply a GenAIScript script individually to a list of files, you can use the [batch](/genaiscript/reference/cli/batch) command.

```sh wrap "batch"
npx --yes genaiscript batch <script> <...files>
```

In this case, the script will be applied to each file in the list, and the output will be stored in an output folder.

## CI/CD

You can use the CLI to run your scripts in a CI/CD pipeline. 
The CLI will return a non-zero exit code if the script fails, which can be used to fail the pipeline.

- use [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) in GitHub Actions to populate the environment variables with secrets.
- use [annotations](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/annotations) to generate SARIF files 
that can be uploaded to GitHub Actions as security reports.
