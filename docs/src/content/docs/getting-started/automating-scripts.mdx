Once you have a script that you are happy with, you can automate it using the [command line interface](/genaiscript/reference/cli).

## Running a script using the CLI

The basic usage of the CLI is to [run](/genaiscript/reference/cli/run/) a script with a tool name and a list of files.

```sh wrap
npx --yes genaiscript run <toolname> <...files>
```

The CLI will use the secrets in the `.env` file and emit the output to the standard output.
[npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx) allows you to run an arbitrary command 
from an npm package (either one installed locally, or fetched remotely).


## CI/CD

You can use the CLI to run your scripts in a CI/CD pipeline. 
The CLI will return a non-zero exit code if the script fails, which can be used to fail the pipeline.

Make sure that the LLM credentials are available in the environment variables 
or that a `.env` file is present in the working directory.

### Edits

Add the `--apply-edits` flag to the CLI to automatically write the file edits.

```sh wrap
npx --yes genaiscript run <toolname> <...files> --apply-edits
```

:::caution

An LLM maybe generate arbitrary code that can be harmful to your system. 
We recommend that you review the modified code before executing it. This could be done through a separate
branch and a pull request.

Refer to [Security and Trust](/genaiscript/reference/security-and-trust) for more discussion.

### Annotations

Use [annotations](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/annotations) to generate SARIF files that can be uploaded to GitHub Actions as security reports.
