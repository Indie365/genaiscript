It is possible to declare [tests](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/tests) in the `script` function
to validate the output of the script.

## Declaring tests

The tests are added as an array of objects in the `tests` key of the `script` function.

```js title="proofreader.genai.js" wrap
scripts({
  ...,
  tests: {
    files: "src/rag/testcode.ts",
    rubrics: "is a report with a list of issues",
    facts: `The report says that the input string 
      should be validated before use.`,
  }
})
```

## Running tests

You can use the cli to run the tests of your script and open the results.

```sh
npx genaiscript test proofreader --view
```

## Known limitations

Currently, promptfoo treats the script source as the prompt text. Therefore, one cannot use assertions
that also rely on the input text, such as `answer_relevance`.
