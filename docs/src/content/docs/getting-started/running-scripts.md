Script in the context of your environment.
**Only run trusted scripts.**

:::

In Visual Studio Code, the location where you start running a script determines the entries in the `env.files` variable.

## Single file

-   Right click on a file in the Explorer and select `Run GenAIScript`.
-   Or right click in a file editor and select `Run GenAIScript`.

The `env.files` will contain a single element with the selected file.

## Folder

-   Right click on a folder in the Explorer and select `Run GenAIScript`.

The `env.files` will contain all nested files under that folder.

## Analyze results

By default, GenAIScript opens the output preview which shows a rendered view of the LLM output (assuming the LLM produces markdown).

You can also use the **Trace** to review the each transformation step of the script execution.

-   Click on the GenAIScript status bar and select `Trace`

## Next steps

[Debug](./debugging-scripts.mdx) your scripts using the Visual Studio Code Debugger!
