It is possible to force the LLM to generate data that conforms to a specific schema.
This technique works reasonably well and GenAIScript also provides automatic validation "just in case".

You will notice that the schema supported by GenAIScript is much simpler than the full-blow JSON schema specification. We recommend using simple schemas to avoid confusing the LLM; then port them to your application
specific data format later on.

## `defSchema`

Use `defSchema` to define a JSON/YAML schema for the prompt output.

```javascript
defSchema("CITY_SCHEMA", {
    type: "array",
    description: "A list of cities with population and elevation information.",
    items: {
        type: "object",
        description: "A city with population and elevation information.",
        properties: {
            name: { type: "string", description: "The name of the city." },
            population: { type: "number", description: "The population of the city." },
            url: { type: "string", description: "The URL of the city's Wikipedia page." }
        },
        required: ["name", "population", "url"]
    }
})
```

### Prompt encoding

Following the [TypeChat approach](https://microsoft.github.io/TypeChat/docs/introduction/),
the schema is converted TypeScript types before being injected in the LLM prompt.
You can change this behavior by using the `{ format: "json" }` option.

```js
defSchema("CITY_SCHEMA", {...}, { format: "json" })
```

:::tip[Read the Trace!]

The trace allows you to see the schema source and the rendered prompt.

<details>
<summary>schema CITY_SCHEMA</summary>

-   source:

```json
{
  "type": "array",
  "description": "A list of cities with population and elevation information.",
  "items": {
    "type": "object",
    "description": "A city with population and elevation information.",
    "properties": {
      "name": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The name of the city."
      },
      "population": {
        "type": "number",
        "description": "The population of the city."
      },
      "url": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The URL of the city's Wikipedia page."
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "name",
      "population",
      "url"
    ]
  }
}
```
-   prompt (rendered as typescript):

```typescript
// A list of cities with population and elevation information.
type CITY_SCHEMA = Array<{
    // The name of the city.
    name: string,
    // The population of the city.
    population: number,
    // The URL of the city's Wikipedia page.
    url: string,
  }>
```

## Use the schema

Then tell the LLM to use this schema to generate data.

```js
$`Use the TARGET_SCHEMA for the JSON schema.`
```


## Validation

When a JSON/YAML payload is generated with the schema identifier,
GenAIScript automatically validates the payload against the schema.

:::tip
Tell the LLM to use YAML instead of JSON as it works better with the LLM tokenizers.
