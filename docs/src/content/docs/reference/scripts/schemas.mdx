It is possible to force the LLM to generate data that conforms to a specific schema.
This technique works reasonably well and GenAIScript also provides automatic validation "just in case".

You will notice that the schema supported by GenAIScript is much simpler than the full-blow JSON schema specification. We recommend using simple schemas to avoid confusing the LLM; then port them to your application
specific data format later on.

## `defSchema`

Use `defSchema` to define a JSON/YAML schema for the prompt output.

```javascript
const schema = defSchema("CITY_SCHEMA", {
    type: "array",
    description: "A list of cities with population and elevation information.",
    items: {
        type: "object",
        description: "A city with population and elevation information.",
        properties: {
            name: { type: "string", description: "The name of the city." },
            population: { type: "number", description: "The population of the city." },
            url: { type: "string", description: "The URL of the city's Wikipedia page." }
        },
        required: ["name", "population", "url"]
    }
})

$`Generate ... using JSON compliant with ${schema}.`
```

### Prompt encoding

Following the ["All You Need Is Types" approach](https://microsoft.github.io/TypeChat/docs/introduction/)
from TypeChat, the schema is converted TypeScript types before being injected in the LLM prompt.

```typescript
// A list of cities with population and elevation information.
type CITY_SCHEMA = Array<{
    // The name of the city.
    name: string,
    // The population of the city.
    population: number,
    // The URL of the city's Wikipedia page.
    url: string,
  }>
```

You can change this behavior by using the `{ format: "json" }` option.

```javascript
const schema = defSchema("CITY_SCHEMA", {...}, { format: "json" })
```

:::tip[Read the Trace!]

The trace allows you to see the schema source and the rendered prompt.

<details>
<summary>schema CITY_SCHEMA</summary>

-   source:

```json
{
  "type": "array",
  "description": "A list of cities with population and elevation information.",
  "items": {
    "type": "object",
    "description": "A city with population and elevation information.",
    "properties": {
      "name": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The name of the city."
      },
      "population": {
        "type": "number",
        "description": "The population of the city."
      },
      "url": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The URL of the city's Wikipedia page."
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "name",
      "population",
      "url"
    ]
  }
}
```
-   prompt (rendered as typescript):

```typescript
// A list of cities with population and elevation information.
type CITY_SCHEMA = Array<{
    // The name of the city.
    name: string,
    // The population of the city.
    population: number,
    // The URL of the city's Wikipedia page.
    url: string,
  }>
  
```

## Use the schema

Then tell the LLM to use this schema to generate data.

```js
const schema = defSchema(...)
$`Use ${schema} for the JSON schema.`
```

## Validation

When a JSON/YAML payload is generated with the schema identifier,
GenAIScript automatically validates the payload against the schema.

:::tip

Not all data formats are equal! Some data formats like JSON introduce ambiguity 
and can confuse the LLM.

:::

## Repair

GenAIScript will automatically try to repair the data by issues additional messages 
back to the LLM with the parsing output.
