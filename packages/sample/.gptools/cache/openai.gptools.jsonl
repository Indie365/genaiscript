The framework leverages foundation models (specifically LLMs) to enable a new kind of scripting that combines traditional code and natural language.\n\n> Don't forget to turn on the sound.\n\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/gptools/assets/4175913/74517b81-4b9c-47d9-8a5c-a15362b0d4db\n\n## Key Objectives and Technical Elements\n\nThe main objectives of gptools are to improve automation, collaboration, and accessibility in the creation, understanding, and maintenance of complex GPT artifacts.\nThe key elements of the gptools framework are:\n\n-   [gptools](./docs/gptools.md): Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language, leveraging foundation models in their execution.\n-   [gpspecs](./docs/gpspecs.md): Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context.\n-   [VS Code extension](./packages/vscode/README.md): Supporting seamless user interaction with gptools.\n-   **gpvm**: A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools.\n\nGPTools access AI foundation models (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Llama, ...) using a [user-provided token](./docs/token.md).\n\n## Install manually\n\nThese are the instructions to install the latest build of the extension manually in Visual Studio Code.\n\n-   open the [latest release](https://github.com/microsoft/gptools/releases/latest/),\n-   download the `gptools.vsix` file\n-   open Visual Studio Code\n-   open the command palette and type **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**\n-   load the `gptools.vsix` file\n\nUntil this extension is in the Marketplace, you will have to repeat these steps each time you want to upgrade the extension.\n\n### GPTool scripts\n\nGPTool scripts use stylized JavaScript with minimal syntax. They are stored as files (`gptools/*.gptool.js`) in your project.\n\n```js\ngptool({\n    title: \"Technical proofreading\",\n    description: \"Reviews the text as a technical document writer.\",\n})\n\ndef(\"TEXT\", env.file)\n\n$`You are reviewing and updating TEXT to fix grammatical errors, fix spelling errors and make it technical.`\n```\n\nGPTools comes with builtin tools and allows you to fork and customize the AI prompts to your project specific needs.\nThis leverages VSCode language support (completion, coloring, error checking)\nwhile remaining friendly to people not very familiar with JavaScript.\nGPTools also provides detailed expansion logs to help you debug your templates.\n\nSince gptool scripts are stored as files in the project, they can be shared, versioned, collaborated on by the entire development team\nusing the existing team development cycle.\n\nIn the future, we foresee that developers will create libraries of gptools and share them as libraries on their favorite package manager.\n\n-   [Read more about gptools](./docs/gptools.md).\n\n## GPSpec specifications\n\nNatural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context. GPTools parses `*.gpspec.md` markdown files as specification.\n\n```markdown A sample GPSpec document.\n# email address recognizer\n\nWrite a function that takes a string argument\nand returns true if the whole string is a valid email address, false otherwise.\n```\n\n-   [Read more about gpspecs](./docs/gpspecs.md).\n\n## User experience\n\nThis diagram demonstrates the AI-enhanced workflow process in gptools.

GPTools uses LLMs to enable a new kind of scripting that combines traditional code and natural language.\n\n> Don't forget to turn on the sound.\n\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/gptools/assets/4175913/74517b81-4b9c-47d9-8a5c-a15362b0d4db\n\n## Key Objectives and Technical Elements\n\nThe main objectives of gptools are to improve automation, collaboration, and accessibility in the creation, understanding, and maintenance of complex GPT artifacts. The key elements of the gptools framework are:\n\n-   [gptools](./docs/gptools.md): Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language, leveraging foundation models in their execution.\n-   [gpspecs](./docs/gpspecs.md): Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context.\n-   [VS Code extension](./packages/vscode/README.md): Supporting seamless user interaction with gptools.\n-   **gpvm**: A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools.\n\nGPTools uses hosted AI foundation models (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Llama, ...) using a [user-provided token](./docs/token.md).\n\n### GPTool scripts\n\nGPTool scripts use stylized JavaScript with minimal syntax. They are stored as files (`gptools/*.gptool.js`) in your project.\n\n```js\ngptool({\n    title: \"Technical proofreading\",\n    description: \"Reviews the text as a tech writer.\",\n})\n\ndef(\"TEXT\", env.file)\n\n$`You are reviewing and updating TEXT \nto fix grammatical errors, \nfix spelling errors and make it technical.`\n```\n\nGPTools comes with builtin tools and allows you to fork and customize the AI prompts to your project specific needs.\nThis leverages VSCode language support (completion, coloring, error checking)\nwhile remaining friendly to people not very familiar with JavaScript.\nGPTools also provides detailed expansion logs to help you debug your templates.\n\nSince gptool scripts are stored as files in the project, they can be shared, versioned, collaborated on by the entire development team\nusing the existing team development cycle.\n\nIn the future, we foresee that developers will create libraries of gptools and share them as libraries on their favorite package manager.\n\n-   [Read more about gptools](./docs/gptools.md).\n\n## GPSpec specifications\n\nNatural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context. GPTools parses `*.gpspec.md` markdown files as specification.

The gpspec starts the `gptool`, which reads the `gpspec`, interacts with the gpvm and foundation model.\nThe AI-generated output is used to update the workspace, and the user interacts with the updated workspace through the gptools extension to VS code.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\nparticipant User\nparticipant VSCode\nparticipant gpspec\nparticipant gptool\nparticipant gpvm\nUser->>VSCode: Create/Edit gpspec\nVSCode->>gpspec: Save gpspec\nUser->>VSCode: Invoke gptool\nVSCode->>gptool: Execute gptool with gpspec + workspace\ngptool->>gpvm: Request foundation model execution\ngpvm->>gptool: Return AI-generated output\ngptool->>VSCode: Update workspace with output\nVSCode->>User: Display updated workspace\n```\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Install in Visual Studio Code\n\nThese are the instructions to install the latest build of the extension manually in Visual Studio Code.\n\n-   install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n-   open the [latest release](https://github.com/microsoft/gptools/releases/latest/),\n-   download the `gptools.vsix` file\n-   open Visual Studio Code\n-   open the command palette and type **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**\n-   load the `gptools.vsix` file\n\nUntil this extension is in the Marketplace, you will have to repeat these steps each time you want to upgrade the extension.\n\n### Try a builtin tool\n\nGPTools comes with sample tools and you don't need a gpspec to run those tools on any file. The easiest way to start playing with GPTools is to:\n\n-   open a folder in Visual Studio Code\n-   open any file, open the context menu and run \"Run GPTool...\"\n-   select one of the builtin tools in the dropdown\n\n### Create a gpspec\n\nThe default gpspec generated by GPTools is rather simplistic.

We'll start by opening the GP spec file, which is a markdown file where we describe the task to do. In this example, we're going to implement an email validator.\n[2] \n[3] Nancy: That's right, Ethan. The task is to write a function that takes a string and validates if the whole string is a valid email address. This description is in natural language, in what we call the GP spec file.\n[4] \n[5] Ethan: Now, this GP spec file is run against a GP tool. The GP tools are JavaScript files defined in the project. Let's open the generate python GP tool, which has some metadata used to populate the UI, a programmatic way to access the context, and the typical prompt engineering using an intuitive syntax.\n[6] \n[7] Nancy: From the user's perspective, they can take the code action tool and select the \"generate python code\" option. This will execute the GP tool against the GP spec and the rest of the context. The results are streamed in Visual Studio Code and previewed as a refactoring.\n[8] \n[9] Ethan: That's right. We can see that a new file is parsed out, and an update to the file is made. If the user is happy with the changes, they can apply them just like any other refactoring. Next, they can run the test generation tool, which is another JavaScript file in the project.\n[10] \n[11] Nancy: When running the test generation tool, we can see that it generates tests but uses the wrong framework. To fix this, the team can update the tool file. After updating the file, they can run the test tool again, and now it picks up the right test framework.\n[12] \n[13] Ethan: Once the tests are generated, they can make sure the tests are passing. Now, let's say the customer changes their mind and decides that the function should also validate URLs. The user can update the spec to reflect this change and run the tool again.\n[14] \n[15] Nancy: When running the tool again, it initially uses the wrong file. The user can refine the spec to use the same pipeline file, run the tool again, and now it regenerates the email validator. They can review the changes and apply them if they're satisfied.\n[16] \n[17] Ethan: And that's it!

And we start by opening the GP spec file, which is a markdown file word to use a described as a task to do. And this example, we're going to have. Implement. An email validator.  We're the task is to write a function. taKes a string and.  Validates that the whole string.  Is a valid email address.  \n\nSo that's the description of the problem in natural language, in what we call the GP spec file.  And these GP fact file.  Is run against a GP tool. The GP tools are JavaScript files defined in the project. We're going to open the generate piped on GP tool.  Which has some metadata, which is used to populate the UI.  It has programattic way to access the, the context, including the content of the GP. B GP spec file.  And then it has the typ typical prompt engineering. Thing here using an intuitive syntax.  \n\nfRom the user, who's writing the GP spec. We go in here and we take the code action tool. And we select the generate pipeline code. So this is going to. Execute the GP tool.  Against the GP spec and the rest of the context, the results are streamed.  In visual studio code and they're also previewed as a refactoring. So we can see that we parsed out. And you file here and we parsed out an update to the file. So if you're happy with that, you can go ahead and apply. The chains are applied, just like any other refactoring. And then why don't we can do now is go in and run the next tool, which is going to be. Test generation tool. So this is another JavaScript filed in project. We run that this is a different prompt. The prompt is about generating test.  Now, in this case, you can see that. It is generating tasks, but using the wrong fair mark.  So this is something that.  We want to fix, add team level. So we're going to go into the tools.  And we're going to update the tool. And this is something that.  THe team is using to generate test. So there we go. You used a union testimonial term for writing tests? We have updated.  The file that the tool file.  \n\nNow let's go back and run the.  Run the test tool again.  \n\nCan we update it?  To fight against. See, now that it is actually.  Picking up the right test framework, which is using our team.  Generating test cases.  \n\nCan I apply that?  Let's get, make sure our tests, our tests are passing.  Now the customer changes mind. And decided that we also had to validate your ELLs. So we're going to go and update. The spec. So write a function via email address or your.  All right. And now I can run this.  \n\nBy applying the tool.  Jerry And code.  And we can see that it is. It is using the wrong, the wrong file. So I'm going to refine my spec and say that we should use the same pipeline file. This goes into the GSB spec file and run again.  \n\nAnd now we're regenerating email validator, which we already have here.  \n\nAnd we have a new refactoring, and if we can look at the diff, we can see that we've actually.  We've kept that function but we've added his valid url and then we also have the function that combines the two that the change does. good we can click apply  And that's it  Thank you for watching \n`````\n\nGenerate a slidedeck in markdown format for the content in SOURCE\nin file src/demovideo.transcript.md.slides.md using markdown.\n\n-  Each slide SHOULD have a title, unless it is only showing a code snippet.\n-  USE heading level 3 for slide titles.\n-  Do NOT add \"Slide:\" or \"Title:\" in the slide.\n-  Keep slides titles VERY short.\n-  USE --- to separate slides.\n-  Keep the content on each slide short.

They are stored as files (`gptools/*.gptool.js`) in your project.\n\n```js\n// metadata\ngptool({\n    title: \"Technical proofreading\",\n    description: \"Reviews the text as a tech writer.\",\n})\n\n// the context\ndef(\"TEXT\", env.file)\ndef(\"RES\", env.links)\n\n// the task\n$`You are reviewing and updating TEXT \nto fix grammatical errors, \nfix spelling errors and make it technical.\nUse information from RES.`\n```\n\nGPTools comes with builtin tools and allows you to fork and customize the AI prompts to your project specific needs.\nThis leverages VSCode language support (completion, coloring, error checking)\nwhile remaining friendly to people not very familiar with JavaScript.\nGPTools also provides detailed expansion logs to help you debug your templates.\n\nSince gptool scripts are stored as files in the project, they can be shared, versioned, collaborated on by the entire development team\nusing the existing team development cycle.\n\nIn the future, we foresee that developers will create libraries of gptools and share them as libraries on their favorite package manager.\n\n-   [Read more about gptools](./docs/gptools.md).\n\n## GPSpec specifications\n\nNatural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context. GPTools parses `*.gpspec.md` markdown files as specification (`env.file`). Links define the content (`env.links`).\n\n```markdown\n# email address recognizer\n\n-   [email_validator.py](./email_validator.py)\n-   [best practices](./shared/best_practices.md)\n\nWrite a function that takes a string\nand returns true if the whole string is a valid email address,\nfalse otherwise.\n```\n\n-   [Read more about gpspecs](./docs/gpspecs.md).\n\n## User experience\n\nThis diagram demonstrates the AI-enhanced workflow process in gptools. The gpspec starts the `gptool`, which reads the `gpspec`, interacts with the gpvm and foundation model.\nThe AI-generated output is used to update the workspace, and the user interacts with the updated workspace through the gptools extension to VS code.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\nparticipant User\nparticipant VSCode\nparticipant gpspec\nparticipant gptool\nparticipant gpvm\nUser->>VSCode: Create/Edit gpspec\nVSCode->>gpspec: Save gpspec\nUser->>VSCode: Invoke gptool\nVSCode->>gptool: Execute gptool with gpspec + workspace\ngptool->>gpvm: Request foundation model execution\ngpvm->>gptool: Return AI-generated output\ngptool->>VSCode: Update workspace with output\nVSCode->>User: Display updated workspace\n```\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Install in Visual Studio Code\n\nThese are the instructions to install the latest build of the extension manually in Visual Studio Code.\n\n-   install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n-   open the [latest release](https://github.com/microsoft/gptools/releases/latest/),\n-   download the `gptools.vsix` file\n-   open Visual Studio Code\n-   open the command palette and type **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**\n-   load the `gptools.vsix` file\n\nUntil this extension is in the Marketplace, you will have to repeat these steps each time you want to upgrade the extension.\n\n### Try a builtin tool\n\nGPTools comes with sample tools and you don't need a gpspec to run those tools on any file. The easiest way to start playing with GPTools is to:\n\n-   open a folder in Visual Studio Code\n-   open any file, open the context menu and run \"Run GPTool...\"\n-   select one of the builtin tools in the dropdown\n\n### Create a gpspec\n\nThe default gpspec generated by GPTools is rather simplistic. You can improve the performance of the LLM\nby creating a new gpspec with more instructions.\n\n### Fork a tool\n\n-   open the command palette\n-   type \"Fork a GPTool...\" and select the tool you want to fork\n-   pick a new name and start editing the tool\n\nThe tool will be available in the dropdown of the \"Run GPTool...\" command.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe accept contributions!

Here are some suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Descriptive Comments**: The comment \"This is my favorite program!\" is not informative. Comments should explain the purpose of the code or any complex logic.\n\n2. **Magic Numbers**: The range `1, 45` is used without explanation. It's better to define such numbers as constants with descriptive names to improve readability and maintainability.\n\n3. **Loop Variables**: The variable `i` is commonly used as an index in loops, which is fine. However, the variable `c` for the second loop could be more descriptive, such as `ascii_code`.\n\n4. **Character Range**: The loop to print the alphabet uses `ord('a')` and `ord('z') + 1`. While this works, it's not immediately clear to a reader what characters are being printed. A comment or a different approach could improve clarity.\n\n5. **Print Statement**: The final print statement \"The end\" is not necessary unless it serves a specific purpose in the context of the program's use.\n\n6. **Extensibility**: If the script is meant to be extended or reused, consider defining functions for each task (e.g., printing numbers, printing the alphabet) to improve modularity.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: There is no error handling in the script. If this script is expanded upon, consider adding error handling to manage unexpected inputs or situations.\n\n8. **Performance**: The current script is straightforward and does not have performance issues. However, if the range of numbers or complexity increases, consider performance implications.\n\n9. **Testing**: There are no tests provided. If this script is part of a larger project, consider adding unit tests to ensure expected behavior.\n\n10. **Documentation**: The script lacks a docstring at the top explaining what the script does. Adding a docstring would provide a clear, high-level description of the script's functionality.\n\nOverall, the script is simple and achieves the task of printing numbers and letters. However, the above suggestions could improve the code quality and maintainability.\n`````"}

They are stored as files (`gptools/*.gptool.js`) in your project.\n\n```js\n// metadata\ngptool({\n    title: \"Technical proofreading\",\n    description: \"Reviews the text as a tech writer.\",\n})\n\n// the context\ndef(\"TEXT\", env.file)\ndef(\"RES\", env.links)\n\n// the task\n$`You are reviewing and updating TEXT \nto fix grammatical errors, \nfix spelling errors and make it technical.\nUse information from RES.`\n```\n\nGPTools comes with builtin tools and allows you to fork and customize the AI prompts to your project specific needs.\nThis leverages VSCode language support (completion, coloring, error checking)\nwhile remaining friendly to people not very familiar with JavaScript.\nGPTools also provides detailed expansion logs to help you debug your templates.\n\nSince gptool scripts are stored as files in the project, they can be shared, versioned, collaborated on by the entire development team\nusing the existing team development cycle.\n\nIn the future, we foresee that developers will create libraries of gptools and share them as libraries on their favorite package manager.\n\n-   [Read more about gptools](./docs/gptools.md).\n\n## GPSpec specifications\n\nNatural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context. GPTools parses `*.gpspec.md` markdown files as specification (`env.file`). Links define the content (`env.links`).\n\n```markdown\n# email address recognizer\n\n-   [email_validator.py](./email_validator.py)\n-   [best practices](./shared/best_practices.md)\n\nWrite a function that takes a string\nand returns true if the whole string is a valid email address,\nfalse otherwise.\n```\n\n-   [Read more about gpspecs](./docs/gpspecs.md).\n\n## User experience\n\nThis diagram demonstrates the AI-enhanced workflow process in gptools. The gpspec starts the `gptool`, which reads the `gpspec`, interacts with the gpvm and foundation model.\nThe AI-generated output is used to update the workspace, and the user interacts with the updated workspace through the gptools extension to VS code.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\nparticipant User\nparticipant VSCode\nparticipant gpspec\nparticipant gptool\nparticipant gpvm\nUser->>VSCode: Create/Edit gpspec\nVSCode->>gpspec: Save gpspec\nUser->>VSCode: Invoke gptool\nVSCode->>gptool: Execute gptool with gpspec + workspace\ngptool->>gpvm: Request foundation model execution\ngpvm->>gptool: Return AI-generated output\ngptool->>VSCode: Update workspace with output\nVSCode->>User: Display updated workspace\n```\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Install in Visual Studio Code\n\nThese are the instructions to install the latest build of the extension manually in Visual Studio Code.\n\n-   install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n-   open the [latest release](https://github.com/microsoft/gptools/releases/latest/),\n-   download the `gptools.vsix` file\n-   open Visual Studio Code\n-   open the command palette and type **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**\n-   load the `gptools.vsix` file\n\nUntil this extension is in the Marketplace, you will have to repeat these steps each time you want to upgrade the extension.\n\n### Try a builtin tool\n\nGPTools comes with sample tools and you don't need a gpspec to run those tools on any file. The easiest way to start playing with GPTools is to:\n\n-   open a folder in Visual Studio Code\n-   open any file, open the context menu and run \"Run GPTool...\"\n-   select one of the builtin tools in the dropdown\n\n### Create a gpspec\n\nThe default gpspec generated by GPTools is rather simplistic. You can improve the performance of the LLM\nby creating a new gpspec with more instructions.\n\n### Fork a tool\n\n-   open the command palette\n-   type \"Fork a GPTool...\" and select the tool you want to fork\n-   pick a new name and start editing the tool\n\nThe tool will be available in the dropdown of the \"Run GPTool...\" command.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe accept contributions!

This does not seem to align with any specific functionality described in the provided specification.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n- **Define the Purpose**: Clarify the goal of the script. If it is meant to demonstrate basic loops, consider adding comments to explain this to the reader.\n- **Use Functions**: Encapsulate the logic in functions to improve modularity and readability. For example, create a function for printing numbers and another for printing the alphabet.\n- **Magic Numbers**: Avoid using magic numbers like `45` and `ord('z') + 1`. Define them as constants with descriptive names to make the code more readable and maintainable.\n- **Range Limits**: If the intention is to print numbers up to 44 and the entire alphabet, the current range is correct. However, if the goal is to include 45 or other characters, adjust the range accordingly.\n- **Final Message**: The final print statement \"The end\" is not necessary unless it serves a specific purpose. If it is for user interaction, consider a more descriptive message.\n\n### Example Refactored Code\n```python\n# Constants for better readability\nNUM_START = 1\nNUM_END = 45\nALPHABET_START = 'a'\nALPHABET_END = 'z'\n\ndef print_numbers(start, end):\n    \"\"\"Prints numbers from start to end (inclusive).\"\"\"\n    for i in range(start, end + 1):\n        print(i)\n\ndef print_alphabet(start_char, end_char):\n    \"\"\"Prints the alphabet from start_char to end_char (inclusive).\"\"\"\n    for c in range(ord(start_char), ord(end_char) + 1):\n        print(chr(c))\n\n# Main execution\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_numbers(NUM_START, NUM_END)\n    print_alphabet(ALPHABET_START, ALPHABET_END)\n    print(\"The counting is complete.\")\n```\n\n### Final Thoughts\n- Ensure the code aligns with the project's goals as outlined in the README and SPEC files. If the script is part of a larger system, consider how it integrates with other components.\n`````\n"}
