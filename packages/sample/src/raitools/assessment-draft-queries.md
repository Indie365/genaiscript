## Project components and timeline

**1.2** The project aims to train an AI assistant to respond to tasks given by users in a way that is faithful to the instructions provided, with a focus on step-by-step reasoning and justification. The timeline includes the development of the model, training, testing, and potential integration into products.

## Supporting material

**1.3** Supplementary information about the project, such as technical reports, model architectures, and datasets, will be linked here.

## Project goal and overview

**1.4** The goal of the project is to create an AI that can understand user tasks, think methodically, and explain its reasoning process transparently.

## Relationship to products

**1.5** The project does not currently have a direct relationship to Microsoft systems or products but could potentially be integrated in the future.

# Section 2: Sharing

## What?

**2.1** At this stage, there are no specific assets planned to be shared publicly.

## Who?

**2.2** The intended recipients of the project's findings are the internal research team and potentially Microsoft's AI product teams in the future.

## Why?

**2.3** The goal for sharing the findings internally is to inform the development of more transparent and explainable AI systems.

# Section 3: Data information and considerations

## Data documentation

**3.1** Links to any dataset onboarding records or additional data documentation will be provided here.

## Data reflections

**3.2** The makeup of the data could impact the quality of responses, bias and fairness, generalization ability, and robustness of the AI assistant.

# Section 4: Project impacts and limitations

## Impacts of sharing

**4.1** Successful sharing will enhance the research field's understanding of explainable AI and contribute to Microsoft's AI capabilities.

## Known limitations

**4.2** The system has limitations, including potential biases, lack of contextual understanding, and the possibility of generating incorrect information (hallucination).

## Risks of sharing

**4.3** Malicious use could lead to the generation of toxic content, misinformation, and other harmful outcomes.

**4.4** Unintentional misuse could arise from misinterpretation of outputs or use in unintended contexts.

## Mitigations for immediate risks

**4.5** Mitigations include diverse and representative data, human feedback, bias detection and correction, ethical guidelines, and transparency.

# Section 5: Thinking into the future

## Possible real-world uses

**5.1** Likely real-world uses include educational tools, resource-constrained applications, specialized AI services, and contributions to AI research.

## Possible real-world misuses

**5.2** Potential misuses include the generation of toxic content, manipulation of information, and exploitation of model biases.

## Stakeholders

**5.3** Stakeholders include the AI research and development team, Microsoft, potential customers, and the broader tech industry.

## Intended Uses

**5.4** The intended use cases are primarily research settings, with insights informing future AI development.

## Harms and mitigations

**5.7** Anticipated harms include the propagation of falsehoods, abusive language, and bias. Mitigations involve improving dataset quality, implementing fact-checking, and developing ethical AI use guidelines.
