Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"162b14c7-4f10-43c7-bcf9-ae844b4b5b89":{"id_":"162b14c7-4f10-43c7-bcf9-ae844b4b5b89","metadata":{"filename":"src/rag/loremipsum.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"src/rag/loremipsum.pdf","metadata":{"filename":"src/rag/loremipsum.pdf"},"hash":"Oir1qj5oGCxG9AN7ZPyI8mKlQYk/2naOUv/yWAHCZpc="}},"hash":"lIoM2CuyRI70wTy/60T0h+wZszLQ1z8YODbP49hHYQA=","text":"Lorem Ipsum \r\n\"Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci \r\nvelit... \" \r\n\"There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is pain... \" \r\n \r\nWhat is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been \r\nthe industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley \r\nof type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but \r\nalso the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in \r\nthe  1960s  with  the  release  of  Letraset  sheets  containing  Lorem  Ipsum  passages,  and  more \r\nrecently  with  desktop  publishing  software  like Aldus  PageMaker  including  versions  of  Lorem \r\nIpsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when \r\nlooking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution \r\nof letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default \r\nmodel text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various \r\nversions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected \r\nhumour and the like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical \r\nLatin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor \r\nat  Hampden-Sydney  College  in  Virginia,  looked  up  one  of  the  more  obscure  Latin  words, \r\nconsectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical \r\nliterature,  discovered  the  undoubtable  source. Lorem  Ipsum  comes  from  sections  1.10.32  and \r\n1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written \r\nin 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The \r\nfirst line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard  chunk  of  Lorem  Ipsum  used  since  the  1500s  is  reproduced  below  for  those \r\ninterested. Sections 1.10.32  and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are \r\nalso  reproduced  in  their  exact  original  form,  accompanied  by  English  versions  from the  1914 \r\ntranslation by H. Rackham. Where can I get some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered \r\nalteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly \r\nbelievable. If you  are going  to use  a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you  need to be  sure there isn't \r\nanything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet \r\ntend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"dc172e56-0e7b-4440-93f5-f6f568ab9932":{"id_":"dc172e56-0e7b-4440-93f5-f6f568ab9932","metadata":{"filename":"src/rag/loremipsum.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"src/rag/loremipsum.pdf","metadata":{"filename":"src/rag/loremipsum.pdf"},"hash":"NBLfE10YIcKF/wdiDwgwz1ELrWLQkvNNjdvFiXVm4E0="}},"hash":"cfVt2fsgBI3W3pIIIQrGL25xJ/mnOa4nAV85NN04SRI=","text":"It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, \r\nto generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
