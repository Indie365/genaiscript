Lorem Ipsum has been \\r\\nthe industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley \\r\\nof type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but \\r\\nalso the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in \\r\\nthe  1960s  with  the  release  of  Letraset  sheets  containing  Lorem  Ipsum  passages,  and  more \\r\\nrecently  with  desktop  publishing  software  like Aldus  PageMaker  including  versions  of  Lorem \\r\\nIpsum. \\r\\nWhy do we use it? \\r\\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when \\r\\nlooking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution \\r\\nof letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. \\r\\nMany desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default \\r\\nmodel text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various \\r\\nversions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected \\r\\nhumour and the like). \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nWhere does it come from? \\r\\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical \\r\\nLatin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor \\r\\nat  Hampden-Sydney  College  in  Virginia,  looked  up  one  of  the  more  obscure  Latin  words, \\r\\nconsectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical \\r\\nliterature,  discovered  the  undoubtable  source.  Lorem  Ipsum  comes  from  sections  1.10.32  and \\r\\n1.10.33 of \\\"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\\\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written \\r\\nin 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The \\r\\nfirst line of Lorem Ipsum, \\\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\\\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. \\r\\nThe standard  chunk  of  Lorem  Ipsum  used  since  the  1500s  is  reproduced  below  for  those \\r\\ninterested. Sections 1.10.32  and 1.10.33 from \\\"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\\\" by Cicero are \\r\\nalso  reproduced  in  their  exact  original  form,  accompanied  by  English  versions  from the  1914 \\r\\ntranslation by H. Rackham. \\r\\nWhere can I get some? \\r\\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered \\r\\nalteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly \\r\\nbelievable.
