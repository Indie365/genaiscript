The task is to write a function that takes a string and validates if the whole string is a valid email address. This description is in natural language, in what we call the GP spec file.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.  Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.  For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.\n`````\n\nPDF:\n```pdf file=src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf\nat Hampden -Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one o f the more obscure Latin words,  consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical  literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and  1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malor um\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written  in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The  first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.  For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.\n"}},"trace":"## rag\n\n\n\n<details id=\"🤖-automation\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n🤖 automation\n</summary>\n\nThis operation can be run from the command line:\n\n```bash\nnode .genaiscript/genaiscript.js run rag src/rag/dir --apply-edits\n```\n\n-   You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).\n-   Configure the OpenAI token in environment variables (run `node .genaiscript/genaiscript help keys` for help).\n-   The `.genaiscript/genaiscript.js` is written by the Visual Studio Code extension automatically.\n-   Run `node .genaiscript/genaiscript help run` for the full list of options.\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"🎰-variables\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n🎰 variables\n</summary>\n\n> Variables are referenced through `env.NAME` in prompts.\n-   env.**error**: `ERROR-HTFQOH`\n-   env.**spec**\n\n````````js\n{ filename: \"src/rag/dir.gpspec.md\",\nlabel: \"context\",\ncontent: \"# Specification\\n\\n-   [Document.docx](./Document.docx)\\n-   [L\"... }\n````````\n-   env.**files**\n\n````````js\n[ { label: \"Document.docx\",\n  filename: \"src/rag/Document.docx\",\n  content: \"PK\\u0003\\u0004\\u0014\\u0000\\u0006\\u0000\\b\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000!\\u0000��\\\\�y\\u0001\\u0000\\u0000�\\u0005\\u0000\\u0000\\u0013\\u0000\\b\\u0002[Content_Types].xml �\\u0004\\u0002(�\\u0000\\u0002\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000\"... },\n{ label: \"Lorem Ipsum.pdf\",\n  filename: \"src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf\",\n  content: \"%PDF-1.7\\r\\n%����\\r\\n1 0 obj\\r\\n<</Type/Catalog/Pages 2 0 R/Lang(e\"... },\n{ label: \"markdown.md\",\n  filename: \"src/rag/markdown.md\",\n  content: \"What is Markdown?\\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language \"... } ]\n````````\n-   env.**parents**\n\n````````js\n[  ]\n````````\n-   env.**fence**\n\n````````markdown\n```\n````````\n-   env.**markdownFence**\n\n````````markdown\n`````\n````````\n-   env.**promptOptions**\n\n````````js\n{  }\n````````\n-   env.**vars**\n\n````````js\n{  }\n````````\n-   env.**functions**\n\n````````js\n[  ]\n````````\n-   env.**schemas**\n\n````````js\n{  }\n````````\n-   env.**template**\n\n````````js\n{ id: \"rag\",\ntitle: \"rag\",\ndescription: undefined }\n````````\n-   env.**secrets**\n\n````````js\n{  }\n````````\n-   env.**chat**\n\n````````js\n{ history: [  ],\nprompt: \"\" }\n````````\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"📄-spec\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n📄 spec\n</summary>\n\n\n````````markdown\n# Specification\n\n-   [Document.docx](./Document.docx)\n-   [Lorem Ipsum.pdf](./Lorem Ipsum.pdf)\n-   [markdown.md](./markdown.md)\n````````\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"🛠️-script\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n🛠️ script\n</summary>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"retreival\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\nretreival\n</summary>\n\n-   query: `markdown`\n-   ✅ indexed src/rag/markdown.md -> src/rag/markdown.md\n-   ✅ indexed src/rag/Document.docx -> src/rag/Document.docx\n-   ✅ indexed src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf -> src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf\n\n````````yaml\n- filename: src/rag/markdown.md\n  id: src/rag/markdown.md_0\n  text: \"What is Markdown?

Contrary\n    to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a\n    piece of classical  Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years\n    old.

The point of using\n    Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more -or-less n ormal distribution  of letters,\n    as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like\n    readable English.  Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now\n    use Lorem Ipsum as their default  model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum'\n    wil l uncover many web sites still in their infancy.

Contrary\n    to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a\n    piece of classical  Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years\n    old.
