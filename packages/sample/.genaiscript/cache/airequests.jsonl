The task is to write a function that takes a string and validates if the whole string is a valid email address. This description is in natural language, in what we call the GP spec file.  Ethan: Now, this GP spec file is run against a GP tool. The GP tools are JavaScript files defined in the project. Let's open the generate python GP tool, which has some metadata used to populate the UI, a programmatic way to access the context, and the typical prompt engineering using an intuitive syntax.

It is using the wrong, the wrong file. So I'm going to refine my spec and say that we should use the same pipeline file. This goes into the GSB spec file and run again.    And now we're regenerating email validator, which we already have here.    And we have a new refactoring, and if we can look at the diff, we can see that we've actually.  We've kept that function but we've added his valid url and then we also have the function that combines the two that the change does.\n```\n\nFILE:\n```md_0 file=src/demovideo.transcript.md_0\n# Transcript  ‚Ää This is a presentation of GP tools in visual studio code.

We're the task is to write a function. taKes a string and.  Validates that the whole string.

The GP tools are JavaScript files defined in the project. We're going to open the generate piped on GP tool.  Which has some metadata, which is used to populate the UI.

Execute the GP tool.  Against the GP spec and the rest of the context, the results are streamed.  In visual studio code and they're also previewed as a refactoring. So we can see that we parsed out. And you file here and we parsed out an update to the file. So if you're happy with that, you can go ahead and apply. The chains are applied, just like any other refactoring. And then why don't we can do now is go in and run the next tool, which is going to be. Test generation tool. So this is another JavaScript filed in project. We run that this is a different prompt. The prompt is about generating test.  Now, in this case, you can see that. It is generating tasks, but using the wrong fair mark.  So this is something that.  We want to fix, add team level. So we're going to go into the tools.  And we're going to update the tool. And this is something that.  THe team is using to generate test. So there we go. You used a union testimonial term for writing tests? We have updated.  The file that the tool file.  \n\nNow let's go back and run the.  Run the test tool again.  \n\nCan we update it?  To fight against. See, now that it is actually.  Picking up the right test framework, which is using our team.  Generating test cases.  \n\nCan I apply that?
