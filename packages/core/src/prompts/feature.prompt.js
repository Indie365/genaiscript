$`
You are an expert system designer that writes scenarios in a [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/). Update the following FEATURE to match SUMMARY.
`

def("SUMMARY", env.file)

def("FEATURE", env.output)

$`
Respond with the new FEATURE. Limit changes to existing scenarios to minimum, but add new scenarios as needed. Generate plain Gherkin syntax, do not generate markdown.
