# genaiscript: AI-Enhanced Workflows for Teams

genaiscript is a framework that empowers teams, including non-developers, to create and use AI-enhanced scripts to support their workflows. The framework leverages foundation models (specifically LLMs) to enable a new kind of scripting that combines traditional code and natural language.

## Key Objectives and Technical Elements

The main objectives of genaiscript are to improve automation, collaboration, and accessibility in the creation, understanding, and maintenance of complex artifacts. The key elements of the genaiscript framework are:

- **genaiscript**: Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language, leveraging foundation models in their execution.
- **gpspecs**: Natural language documents that instantiate genaiscript in a particular context.
- **gpvm**: A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and genaiscript.
- **VS Code extension**: Supporting seamless user interaction with genaiscript.

The genaiscript framework is designed to be modular and reusable, allowing for easier understanding and customization by non-developers. It enables users to author and maintain gpspecs and genaiscript at various levels of expertise, from professional developers to non-developers.

## Heilmeier Catechism

### What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.

We aim to empower teams, including non-developers, with AI-enhanced scripts that support their efforts in creating, understanding, and maintaining complex artifacts.

### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?

Today, software development and other complex workflows involve a mix of manual and automated processes. Current AI models can perform tasks that traditional software cannot, but they have limitations, such as making mistakes and lacking transparency.

### What is new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful?

Our approach separates scripts into two related parts: a generic reusable _gptool_ and a natural language _gpspec_ that instantiates the gptool in a particular context. This allows for modularity, reuse, and easier understanding by non-developers. We believe this approach will be successful because it combines the power of AI with human oversight and understanding.

### Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?

Developers, non-developers, and organizations will benefit from improved automation, collaboration, and accessibility in their workflows. The existence of genaiscript can empower non-developers to automate their workflows in ways that were previously impossible.

### What are the risks and payoffs?

The risks include AI model mistakes and lack of transparency. The payoffs are increased automation, collaboration, and accessibility in complex workflows.

### How much will it cost?

The cost depends on the development, testing, and deployment of the genaiscript framework and its components.

### How long will it take?

The timeline depends on the development, testing, and deployment of the genaiscript framework and its components.

### What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?

Midterm success would involve successful implementation and user adoption of the genaiscript framework. Final success would be widespread usage and improved workflows across various domains.
