It should provide a function `format_output(game_result)` that takes a dictionary containing the game result and returns a formatted string that can be printed to the console.\n\n4. dealer.py: This module contains the Dealer class, which implements the dealer's logic. The class should have a method `stand_or_draw(hand_value)` that takes the dealer's current hand value and returns a boolean indicating whether the dealer should stand (True) or draw (False).\n\nCommand Line Client:\nThe command line client is implemented in `main.py`. It imports the necessary modules, calls the appropriate functions, and prints the formatted output. To run the client, simply execute `python main.py` in the command line."}

To run the application, users can execute `python main.py` in the terminal. The client will provide clear prompts for user input and display the game state and results in a user-friendly format. The client will also include documentation on how to use it, either as comments in the code or as a separate README file.\n`````"}
